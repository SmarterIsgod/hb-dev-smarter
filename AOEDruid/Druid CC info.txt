Druid info:
Druids use a buff called Mark of the Wild [MOTW]. It has 60 min duration
and will remove any form you're currently in. This should be on at all times.

When pulling you want to be in cat form and you would typically use Feral Charge (Cat) 
to get to your target faster. If it is on cooldown you'd just run to the target.

Barkskin can be cast in any form.

The following spells can only be cast while in catform:
Mangle
Swipe
Survival Instincts
Feral Charge (Cat)
